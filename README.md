#### 1000 App Pledge

The 1000 App Pledge is a challenge I have set out for me to create 1000 apps. I'm doing this to help build my portfolio and improve my development skills. The apps I will develop will range from very simple to very complex and useful.

This the 5th app I developed under this pledge.

# Location Logs
Location logs is a very useful logging app for keeping records of your location with some extra information like network, battery and weather information. This app servers both general and security usecases.

**Minimum SDK Version:** 19

**Clone and import in Android Studio to mess around.**

#### Features
1. Easily create logs of your location with network, battery and weather information of that place.
2. Customize what you want to log.
3. Automatically converts your coordinates into an address.
4. Automatically gets the weather conditions at your location.
5. Swipe left to delete any log.
6. Click on the coordinates to open the location on google maps.
